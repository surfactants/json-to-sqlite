# json-to-sqlite
 parses json files and stores the data in an sqlite database
 
 ## to use
 
 simply add your json files to `data/` and record them in `manifest.txt`
 
 the example files are derived from a game for which i made this program
 
 ## caveats

- one table per json file
- cannot handle binary data
