# json-to-sqlite
 Parses JSON files and stores the data in an sqlite database.
 
 ## to use
 
 Simply add your JSON files to `data/` and record them in `manifest.txt`
 
 The example files are derived from a game, for which I made this program.
 
 ## caveats

- One table per json file
- Cannot handle binary data
